frequency is counted by counting the clock ticks of the FPGA clock within each clock cycle of the input signal (the frequency under test).
at the start of each input cycle (oscillator output), the measurement is stored in the first place of a 8-place buffer. The output is the rolling average of the last 8 periods.

two versions implemented:
v2.0  - everything happens within one process
vb0.5 - things are split into two processes, one does the counting and one stores the data in a buffer with 8 places

both give almost the same logic usage etc and both have maximum operating frequencies much higher than needed. version b (vb0.5) can run faster than version a, but is already too quick.
