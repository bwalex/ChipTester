% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
\author{}% <-this % stops a space
% \thanks{Manuscript received January 20, 2002; revised November 18, 2002.
%         This work was supported by the IEEE.}% <-this % stops a space
% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also the first \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "A\textbf{} \textbf{}B" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". If you want
% "AB" then you have to do: "A\textbf{}\textbf{}B"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\label{sec:work_breakdown}

What were your group’s strengths and weaknesses?  How did you allocate responsibilities to different members of the group?  Did you all contribute equally, or did some people do more work than others?

Grade your group’s work breakdown /10




\section{Planning and Progress}
\label{sec:planning}

How did the group plan the project?  Which suggestions were yours?  To what extent did you manage to follow the plan?  What adjustments did you have to make?
