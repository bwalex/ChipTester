Overlay and Patch queue
==========
The overlay and patch queue allow for patches to be applied to submodules, as well as overlaying
regular files and directories.
This is useful as it allows us to integrate fixes, custom configuration, custom applications, etc,
with third party software such as u-boot or uClinux without making a mess.

The 'patchq' directory contains one subdirectory for each submodule that needs patching. The .patch
files in each of these subdirectories is applied to each of the submodules (when running
'make patch')

Similarly, the 'overlay' directory contains one subdirectory for each submodule (that requires
overlaying). The content of the subdirectories is laid on top of the submodule itself (when
running 'make patch')




Bootstrap of submodules (do this exactly ONCE)
==========
git submodule init
git submodule update

make patch

source ./build_env.sh

cd uClinux-dist
make menuconfig


Select the following:
Kernel/Library/Defaults Selection  ---> 
	[X] Customize Kernel Settings (NEW)

< Exit >
< Exit >
< Yes >
< Exit >




(Re)Building uCLinux
==============
make patch

source ./build_env.sh

cd uClinux-dist
make




(Re)Building u-boot (currently broken in the new infrastructure, but binary available in dist/u-boot.bin)
============
source ./env.sh

cd u-boot
make my_nios2_config
make
